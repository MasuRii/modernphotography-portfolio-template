  "bio": "Elena Vashchenko is a contemporary photographer based in Tokyo, known for her cinematic approach to street and portrait photography. With a background in film direction, she treats every frame as a scene from a movie that was never made. Her work explores the silent dialogue between urban architecture and the human condition.",
  "philosophy": "I believe that photography is not about capturing reality, but about creating a new one. It's an act of subtraction—removing the noise to reveal the essence of a moment. In a world screaming for attention, I look for the whispers.",
